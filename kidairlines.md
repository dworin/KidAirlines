KidAirlines is an airline reservation system that kids can use when playing.  It simulates the way reservation systems looked in the 80s and 90s, using a retro terminal based interface that allows interaction through keystrokes and arrow keys.

All data is stored locally in an SQLLite data base.  Code is written in python.

It has the following functionality.

1. View routes and flights
2. Book tickets for passengers
3. For each passenger, view their reservations
4. For each reservation, view the itinerary
5. For each flight, view the passenger manifest
6. A configuration screen that allows a selection of airports that the airline serves and the creation of routes
7. The ability to create, edit, and manage reservations
