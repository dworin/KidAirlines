# Realistic Flight Times Update

## Summary

KidAirlines has been updated with **realistic flight times** based on actual distances and aircraft performance characteristics. This makes the application more educational and authentic.

## What Changed

### Previous System
- All flights had generic 4-hour duration (08:00-12:00 or 14:00-18:00)
- No differentiation between short and long routes
- Fixed 2 flights per day per route
- All aircraft had 150-seat capacity
- **308 flights total** over 7 days

### New System
- **Realistic durations** based on actual distances
- **Variable frequency** - more flights on short routes, fewer on long routes
- **Appropriate aircraft sizing** - 120 to 250 seats based on route type
- **Realistic scheduling** - morning, afternoon, evening, overnight services
- **378 flights total** over 7 days (54 per day)

## Flight Duration Examples

### Short Routes (1-3 hours)
- **EWR ↔ BWI** (Baltimore): 1h - *Shuttle service, 4 flights/day*
- **EWR ↔ DTW** (Detroit): 2h - *3 flights/day*
- **EWR ↔ ORD** (Chicago): 2.5h - *3 flights/day*
- **EWR ↔ MIA** (Miami): 3h - *3 flights/day*

### Medium Routes (3-6 hours)
- **EWR ↔ OMA** (Omaha): 3h - *2 flights/day*
- **EWR ↔ SFO** (San Francisco): 6h 10m eastbound, 5h 40m westbound - *3 flights/day*

### Long Routes (7-11 hours)
- **EWR ↔ LHR** (London): 7h eastbound, 7.5h westbound - *2 flights/day*
- **EWR ↔ CDG** (Paris): 7.5h eastbound, 8h westbound - *2 flights/day*
- **EWR ↔ CAI** (Cairo): 11h both ways - *1 flight/day*

### Ultra-Long Routes (15+ hours)
- **EWR ↔ DPS** (Bali): 19h eastbound, 18h westbound - *1 flight/day*

## Technical Implementation

### Route Schedules Dictionary
Located in `src/database/db_init.py`, the `route_schedules` dictionary defines flight times:

```python
route_schedules = {
    route_id: [
        (departure_time, duration_in_minutes, capacity),
        # Multiple entries for multiple daily flights
    ]
}
```

**Example:**
```python
1: [('06:00', 120, 150), ('12:00', 120, 150), ('18:00', 120, 150)],  # EWR->DTW (2h)
4: [('06:30', 60, 120), ('10:00', 60, 120), ('14:00', 60, 120), ('18:00', 60, 120)],  # EWR->BWI (1h)
6: [('20:00', 1140, 250)],  # EWR->DPS Bali (19h) - overnight
```

### Automatic Arrival Time Calculation
The `calculate_arrival_time()` function:
- Takes departure time and duration in minutes
- Calculates arrival time automatically
- Handles next-day arrivals (for overnight flights)
- Returns properly formatted time string (HH:MM)

### Aircraft Capacity Assignments
Different aircraft sizes for different route types:
- **120 seats**: Regional jets (BWI shuttle)
- **150 seats**: Narrow-body domestic
- **180 seats**: Large narrow-body (high-traffic routes)
- **220 seats**: Wide-body (transatlantic)
- **250 seats**: Large wide-body (ultra-long-haul)

## Realistic Features

### 1. Variable Flight Frequencies
Not all routes have the same number of daily flights:
- **Ultra-short routes** (EWR-BWI): 4 flights/day (shuttle service)
- **Short domestic**: 3 flights/day (morning, afternoon, evening)
- **Medium domestic**: 2-3 flights/day
- **Transatlantic**: 2 flights/day (evening departures, day returns)
- **Ultra-long-haul**: 1 flight/day (overnight service)

### 2. Wind and Weather Effects
Simulated through different eastbound/westbound durations:
- **Transatlantic**: Westbound +30-60 minutes (headwinds)
- **Transcontinental**: Eastbound -30 minutes (jet stream tailwind)

### 3. Overnight Service
International flights depart evening, arrive next morning:
- **EWR-DPS (Bali)**: Depart 20:00, arrive 15:00 next day
- **EWR-CAI (Cairo)**: Depart 19:30, arrive 06:30 next day
- **EWR-LHR (London)**: Depart 19:00/22:00, arrive 02:00/05:00 next day

### 4. Business Travel Patterns
- Early morning departures to business cities (ORD, DTW)
- Evening returns for same-day business trips
- Red-eye flights for transcontinental (late night departures)
